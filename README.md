## 💻 About Me

I'm a freelance developer focused on delivering smart, scalable, and clean solutions.  
I work fast and efficiently — with a strong bias toward **Python**, **APIs**, and **React-based UIs**.

- 💡 Projects: automation, bots, internal tools, SaaS MVPs
- 🔧 Stack: `Python`, `FastAPI`, `Flask`, `Node.js`, `React`, `Tailwind`, `PostgreSQL`
- 🔐 Also familiar with auth, payments, and role-based systems
- 🌍 100% remote, async-friendly
